After enjoying several strong years, the hybrid smartwatch market is now experiencing a noticeable decline. A number of companies such as Fossil, Skagen, Kronaby, and even the industry giant Garmin have either exited the space or are slowly fading from relevance. Yet, a handful of brands have managed to survive and adapt. Let’s take a closer look at these resilient players and what they’re bringing to the table.

### Withings ScanWatch
A French brand with a strong focus on health and wellness, it was acquired by Nokia in 2016 before regaining its independence in 2018. Despite a 30 days battery life claim, several users reported it's closer to half that. Withings watches features a small oled screen and comes in different styles.

Pros:
- Beautiful design
- Not too big/thick
- Health data & sleep analysis, developed with doctors
- Cycle, temperature tracking & symptom logging

Cons:
- Bad customer service
- Paywall on some app features

### Sequent world
Another French brand, powering its watches through solar or kinetic energy, meaning recharging is rarely necessary. However, due to the company’s small size, there aren’t many online reviews available. New models are typically launched via Kickstarter campaigns.

Pros:
- Nice design
- Long battery life
- Simple app with good ratings

Cons:
- Huge, like really huge
- Expensive
